# Federalist + U.S. Web Design System + Jekyll

This [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) is developed using the [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) and is focused on providing developers a starter kit and reference implementation for Federalist websites.

This code uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site engine and built with Ruby. If you prefer to use Javascript, check out [federalist-uswds-gatsby](https://github.com/18F/federalist-uswds-gatsby), which uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site engine.

This project strives to be compliant with requirements set by [21st Century IDEA Act](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/senate-passes-idea-act/). The standards require that a website or digital service:

- is accessible to individuals with disabilities;
- has a consistent appearance;
- does not duplicate any legacy websites (the legislation also requires agencies to ensure that legacy websites are regularly reviewed, removed, and consolidated);
- has a search function;
- uses an industry standard secure connection;
- “is designed around user needs with data-driven analysis influencing management and development decisions, using qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and behaviors, and continually test the website, web-based form, web-based application, or digital service to ensure that user needs are addressed;”
- allows for user customization; and
- is mobile-friendly.

## Comparison with [uswds-jekyll](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll)

Both start off looking very similar, but differ in what use cases they are best for. Are you:

- Wanting to have a starter template that you can highly customize?
- Comfortable editing HTML and CSS source code?

use federalist-uswds-jekyll (this repository). If you:

- Want to use a theme that you can set and forget
- Are ok with sticking with the general look and feel provided

use uswds-jekyll.

## Key Functionality
This repository contains the following examples and functionality:
 
✅  Publish blog posts, press releases, announcements, etc. To modify this code, check out `blog/index.html`, which manages how the posts are listed. You should then check out `_layouts/post.html` to see how individual posts are structured.

✅ Publish single one-off pages. Instead of creating lots of folders throughout the root directory, you should put single pages in `_pages` folder and change the `permalink` at the top of each page. Use sub-folders only when you really need to.

✅  Publish data (for example: job listings, links, references), you can use the template `_layouts/data.html`. Just create a file in you `_pages` folder with the following options:

```
---
title: Collections Page
layout: data
permalink: /collections
datafile: collections
---
```

The reference to `datafile` referers to the name of the file in `_data/collections.yml` and loops through the values. Feel free to modify this as needed.

✅  There are two different kinds of `pages`, one does not have a side bar navigation, and the other uses `_includes/sidenav.html`. You can enable this option by adding `sidenav: true` to your page front matter.

```
---
title: Document with Sidenav
layout: page
sidenav: true
permalink: /document-with-sidenav
---
```

✅ [Search.gov](https://search.gov) integration - Once you have registered and configured Search.gov for your site by following [these instructions](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/search/), add your "affiliate" and "access key" to `_config.yml`. Ex.

```
searchgov:

  # You should not change this.
  endpoint: https://search.usa.gov

  # replace this with your search.gov account
  affiliate: federalist-uswds-example

  # replace with your access key
  access_key: xX1gtb2RcnLbIYkHAcB6IaTRr4ZfN-p16ofcyUebeko=

  # this renders the results within the page instead of sending to user to search.gov
  inline: true
```

The logic for using Search.gov can be found in `_includes/searchgov/form.html` and supports displaying the results inline or sending the user to Search.gov the view the results. This setting defaults to "inline" but can be changed by setting
```
searchgov:
  inline: false
```
in `_config.yml`.

✅ [Digital Analytics Program (DAP)](https://digital.gov/services/dap/) integration - Once you have registered your site with DAP add your "agency" and optionally, `subagency` to `_config.yml` and uncomment the appropriate lines. Ex.

```
dap:
  # agency: your-agency

  # Optional
  # subagency: your-subagency
```

✅ [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) integration - If you have a Google Analytics account to use, add your "ua" to `_config.yml` and uncomment the appropriate lines. Ex.

```
ga:
  # ua: your-ua
```

## How to edit
- Non-developers should focus on editing markdown content in the `_posts` and `_pages` folder

- We try to keep configuration options to a minimum so you can easily change functionality. You should review `_config.yml` to see the options that are available to you. There are a few values on top that you **need** to change. They refer to the agency name and contact information. The rest of `_config.yml` has a range of more advanced options.

- The contents inside `assets/` folder store your Javascript, SCSS/CSS, images, and other media assets are managed by  [jekyll-assets](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-assets).  Assets are combined, compressed, and automatically available in your theme

- If you look at `package.json` you will see that the `npm run federalist` command that will run when running on the Federalist platform.

- Do not edit files in the `_site/` folder. These files are auto-generated, and any change you make in the folder will be overwritten.

- To edit the look and feel of the site, you need to edit files in `_includes/` folder, which render key components, like the menu, side navigation, and logos.

- `index.html` may not require much editing, depending on how you customize `hero.html` and `highlights.html`.

- `_layouts/` may require the least amount of editing of all the files since they are primarily responsible for printing the content.

- `blog/index.html` can be edited, but be careful. It will impact the pagination system for the posts. If you do edit the file, be prepared to edit `_config.yml`.  For example, you may need go change configurations for [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)

- `search/index.html` is used by search.gov.

## Technologies you should be familiarize yourself with

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - The primary site engine that builds your code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `--` tags. This is meta data that helps Jekyll build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov)
